# Uber-Fares-prediction
In this project, i predicted Uber ride fares through data understanding, cleaning, feature extraction, and analysis. i handled missing values, duplicates, encoding, and scaling. i built and evaluated models using GridSearch, and finally applied Ensemble Learning with StackingRegressor to boost performance and saved the final model.
