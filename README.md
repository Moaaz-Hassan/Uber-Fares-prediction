## Uber Fares Prediction

This project aims to predict Uber ride fares using a full machine learning pipeline. The process includes:

**Data Understanding & Cleaning**: Identified column types, handled errors, missing values, and outliers.

**Feature Engineering & EDA**: Extracted meaningful features and performed univariate and bivariate analysis to understand data behavior.  
Calculated ride distance using pickup and dropoff latitude/longitude coordinates.

**Preprocessing**: Applied encoding techniques, removed duplicates, and scaled features.

**Modeling**:
- Trained baseline models and tuned them using GridSearch.
- Handled bias vs. variance trade-off.
- Implemented **Ensemble Learning using StackingRegressor** to improve accuracy.

**Model Saving**: Saved the final pipeline Preprocesor and model .
